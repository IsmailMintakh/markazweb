                            1	THE ORGANIZATION

1.1	Introduction
Anchan Foundation for Tarqiyati Amor Baltistan (AFTAB) was created in 2023 to address the important issues of Skardu in particular and Baltistan in general. AFTAB is headed by the well-known religious scholar Agha Mohammad Baqir AlHussaini. The organisation was created when Skardu was hit by an acute shortage of water for drinking as well as for irrigation. The call for water diversion from Fiya Lung Nala to Satpara Dam, has been appreciated by all walk of life including all religious, political, linguistic segments. 
1.2	Goal and Objectives
The goal of this organisation is to improve the living standard of the people living across Baltistan in collaboration with local communities while the objectives are;
•	To minimise miseries of the people living in Skardu by providing necessities of live and facilitate people in collaboration with local communities and national & international development agencies. 
•	To create inter faith harmony in Baltistan and increase coordination between various segments of the society as well revive the tradition of unity of Baltistan and initiate self-help basis communal projects. 
1.3	A short Intro of Baltistan 
Baltistan region is situated at the North-eastern corner of Pakistan and located in the recently named “Gilgit-Baltistan”. The boundaries of contemporary Baltistan (‘Baltiyul’ as known to locals) is defined by Gilgit in the west, Indian part of Ladakh in the east, Kashmir in the south, and to the north across the crest of the Karakoram Mountain range exists Xinjiang. The region is at the junction of central Asia, China, and India, giving her a very significant location for both traders and tourists. Baltistan comprises of five major valleys, namely Rondo, Skardu, Shigar, Kharmang and Khapulo. Administratively, the region is divided into four districts; Skardu, Ghanche, Shigar and Kharmang. The population of the region is approximately 500,000 with an annual growth rate of 2.2%, which puts subsequent pressure on its fragile and underdeveloped resources. There are 245 villages scattered over an area of approximately 28,000 sq. kilometres. The lingua franca of Baltistan is Balti, a dialect of Tibetan language known as Tibeto Barman. Literate male individuals also possess adequate knowledge of Urdu and English.
Skardu is the capital of Baltistan and the second largest city in Gilgit Baltistan. This city is densely populated because every year housands of families shift to Skardu from rural areas of Baltistan particularly from boarder areas to get better job and business opportunities and to avail better educational and health facilities. Skardu is one of the fast-growing cities and every year 10 to 15 thousand new houses are constructed. Every year millions of tourists visit this area which has created jobs and earning opportunities to the people but also shrinking the resources of the area such as water, electricity etc.

2	The Project 
2.1	Background of the Project 
Skardu, the capital of Baltistan region and the second largest city in Gilgit Baltistan has a population of 250,000 living in 35,000 households. Majority of the People in Skardu practice subsistence agriculture farming having a mix herd of livestock and a fair number of fruit and farm forest trees. Surrounded by mighty Himalayan range on the left side and the Karakorum range on the right side prevent the monsoon rain system reaching to the area, thus farming is solely dependent on glacier fetch and snow melt water through seasonal streams. The main seasonal streams (Nalas) are Devo Sai Nala, Burgay Nala, Shagari Nala and Hussainabad Nala. The city and its surroundings villages receive irrigation and drinking water from the Devo Sai Nala. A well-designed centuries old water system is functioning in the area for irrigation. To store the seasonal snow melt water for irrigation, a lake (Satpara lake) was constructed few centuries ago. However, few decades back this lake was converted into a Dam (Satpara Dam) to provide sufficient and in time irrigation water to the area. It was said that the Dam project has four components including (a) Construction of Dam, (b) Development of irrigation system in the Dam Command area, and (c) Construction of powerhouses, and (d) diversion of Shatung Nala from Devo Sai. Unfortunately, the last part (Shatung diversion) is not matured yet, which has impacted on the dam efficiency.
Although the command area of Satpara Dam includes from Thorgo to Hotto, however Water Right communities include town area and half of UC Shagari Khurd.These settlements are the traditional water rights areas and managing the irrigation water for centuries. Approximately, 20,000 households are living in the water right area and holds small pieces of lands, few number of trees, and rear few livestock. Along with subsistence agriculture, people are engaged in business and jobs. 
This area never had acute water shortage in the past particularly for drinking but this year (2023) the worst water crisis saw in Skardu where people were fighting for drinking water while irrigation water was not available till June in most of the parts of the mentioned areas. Although this years was a drought year but the magnitude of water crisis in Skardu city was too high. In many cases trees and crops were damaged and farmers have lost their livelihood means. The month of June which was considered the greenest month and the summer season used to be in its full form, but due to non-availability of water for irrigation, tree leaves have changed their color and presenting autumn.
2.1.1	Map of Skardu


2.1.2	Topography
The terrain is hard and inaccessible as majestic mountains of the Himalayan, Karakoram and Ladakh ranges characterize the area. More than nineteen peaks surpassing 7,600 meters above sea level - including K-2, the second highest mountain in the world - are located in Baltistan, gaining her world fame as ‘Paradise of Mountaineers’. Glaciers, the longest in the world outside the Polar Regions reaching ninety miles in length, surround Baltistan in the north and west, separating her from China and Gilgit. Baltistan can best be described as a mountain desert, as it falls outside the monsoon rainfall coverage area. Most of the region lies above 2,000 meters from sea level, and settled farming communities are found even at an altitude of 3,500 meters above sea level. The world famous river Indus, which is augmented by the glacial Zanskar, Suru, Shyok and Shigar rivers, sweeps through Baltistan after its course in Ladakh and Tibet and supports local farming system. Placed at the fringes of the Tibetan plateau, the unique ecosystem of Baltistan supports the subsistence livelihood of Baltis as well the native wildlife. The region is abundant with resources like minerals, innumerable variety of ferrous and non-ferrous elements, gems, precious and semi-precious stones.
2.1.3	Living pattern 
Composed of working-class peasants (subsistence farming class), the majority of the population relies on horticulture, animal husbandry, subsistence farming, and semi-skilled or unskilled jobs to support livelihoods, which provide nominal opportunity for a largely illiterate population. Agriculture is essentially based on irrigation with water supply from the glacial streams and rivers. Induction of youngsters into Pakistani Army and other law enforcing agencies is so far the major source of government employment in the region, which provides much needed cash for the residents. During the years when it is relatively calm on the border with India, around five thousand tourists both local and international visit Baltistan and local masses may find seasonal employment as porters and mountain guides. Moreover, during the seven months of long winter, economic activities slow down and people head off to larger cities of Pakistan to find seasonal labour. Since last decade, trade is flourishing in towns, where food items, clothing and construction material, imported either from China or Islamabad are sold. A small number of people are employed with government agencies, NGOs and private sector. 
Despite many efforts from Government and Non-Governmental Organizations the region is still counted in backward areas of Pakistan. The average cultivated land holding is one acre per household (average), which is too small even to meet the subsistence need of a family of average 7.2 people. Consequently, more than half of the cereal and vegetable requirements of Baltistan are being imported from other parts of Pakistan.    
2.1.4	Unique Characteristics 
Typically, the challenges include remoteness, economic and political marginality, out-migration (among youth) and in-migration (from boarder areas), environmental sensitivity, diversity of livelihoods, and cultural and religious diversity. The decisions on formulating policies for development of Skardu in particular and Baltistan in general, are taken by political and economic circles elsewhere in the country rather than the local people. The interests behind these decisions are adhoc and short-term rather than consistent and long-term. 
2.1.5	Water Resources 
The mountains and glaciers of Baltistan play a crucial role in providing fresh drinking water for the growing population of Pakistan; as well for industrial development and irrigation. The Indus River, along with other rivers of Baltistan serve as tributary for principal water catchments, which is the main source of Tarbella Dam (72%), upon which, irrigation and hydroelectricity potential of Pakistan depends. Food security, poverty alleviation and ultimately, political stability of the country are thus critically linked to the water resources of Baltistan. 
2.1.6	Biodiversity 
Owing to climatic and topographic diversity, the mountain ranges and valleys of Baltistan host a wide range of biodiversity. The Devo Sai Plateau has been described as one of the “wonders of the World”. Baltistan has longest glaciers in the world other than the Polar Regions, including Baltoro. Yet the natural heritage of ecosystems is vulnerable and can be easily destroyed, particularly on slopes at high altitudes. Due to their sensitivity, mountain ecosystems tend to react to environmental degradation and global environmental trends earlier and more clearly than lowland ecosystems. Therefore, protection of this biodiversity including human using sustainable management tools is extremely important for a sustainable development of the region.
2.1.7	Cultural Heritage
Baltistan is the melting pot of civilizations and a great diversity of cultures is found here. The richness and diversity of this global heritage is at risk due to rapid social changes and cultural degradation. Reasons of change include population pressure, poverty, migration, and global dominance of urban values transmitted to the remote areas by mass media, standardized formal education, and mass level tourism. Measures to counter this cultural erosion are needed, as cultural identity and self-esteemed are essential. There are many rock carving and other monuments from Bonism and Buddhism religions which were practiced in this area before introduction of Islam by Syed Ali Hamadani and other Muslim preachers coming from Iran and other places. The Balti culture is a mixture of Tibetan and Iranian cultures. Since, most of the population follow the Shia Islamic school of thought therefore, Iranian culture can be seen in daily life particularly in religious ceremonies and practices. The Tibetan culture can be seen in non-religious practices such as traditional music, stories and ceremonies. Once a very liberal society is now converting into religious fanatic particularly after Iranian revolution and then mass killing of Shias in other parts of the country, this need to be catered by developing the area. 03468484959
2.2	Water Crisis in the year 2023
There are millions of people all over the world who don’t have access to sufficient water. About 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, and 3% of it is actually freshwater that is fit for human consumption. Around two-thirds of that is in shape of glaciers and unavailable for human use. Water scarcity is often divided into two categories: physical scarcity, when there is a shortage of water because of local ecological conditions; and economic scarcity, when there is inadequate water infrastructure.

The year 2023 was the worst year in terms of shortage of water for drinking as well as for irrigation. Many incidences were noticed where people were fighting to each other for water. Since, in most of the cases, women are responsible for fetching water for household consumption therefore, they were the most affected group among the drinking water users. Women have to travel a long distance and also used to stay for hours in que to fetch water from springs and wells as well as from water tankers provided by philanthropists. 
Skardu, never had faced such a water crisis in its history because of locally managed water management system, however after construction of Satpara Dam, the traditional system has been weakened and water management has gone to WAPDA, while WAPDA failed to manage water from the Dam because of delay in Shatung diversion. Some of the main reasons for water crisis in Skardu are given below: 
2.3	Reasons of water shortage
There are many reasons for water shortage in Skardu city and surroundings, few of them are given below;
2.3.1	Increase in population 
Once a small town Skardu, is now the second largest city in GB. The rapid growth in population is because of migration from rural areas to Skardu for better jobs, businesses, to get quality education and health facilities, and to enjoy urban life. The population of Skardu MC and three UCs surrounding the city (Hussainabad, Shagari Khurd and Shagari Kalan) has been shoot-up from 6,838 (households) in 1998 to 19,293 in 2017 leading an increase of 182% in the population and most of the immigrants are living in Skardu city or in surroundings. The source of water for drinking as well as for irrigation is the Satpara Dam with a carrying capacity of roughly 93,310 acres feet which never filled yet because of shortage of snow melt water from upstream mountains. 
2.3.2	Increase in tourists 
Tourist flow in Skardu has also been gown up for the last few years, last year it was around 2 million. Since most of the hotels, motels, and guest houses are in Skardu city and surroundings therefore, use of amount of water in these hotels is high leaving the locals population in a situation where they do not get water for drinking and for irrigation during winter and spring seasons. 
2.3.3	Inefficiency of Dam 
The Dam with a storage capacity of 93,310 acres feet of water has been constructed on Satpara stream near Satpara village (south of Skardu city). The Satpara stream originating from Devosai Planes, is a left tributary of the Indus River and flows from South to North direction. The dam is a multipurpose project primarily for irrigation and drinking water and also for generating 17.3 MW electric power, and controlling floods. The Stapara Dam and Power Houses along with the canals system have been completed for a long time but Shatung diversion is still pending. The Dam cannot be achieved it purpose without its original design where the Shatung Nala was supposed to divert in the Dam. Without water diversion from Shatung nala, the Dam will not be provided the required water for the command area. This year till the end of Jun, the Dam was not full and soon the water from various small rivulets will be exhausted leaving the Dam half full. 
2.3.4	Lack of Planning and waste of water 
Water management is important to provide sufficient water to its users, but unfortunately, in Skardu lack of management can be seen where haphazard water schemes are installed without realising water availability, poor water infrastructures, and lack of quality services. Furthermore, post project maintenance is also pathetic and everywhere pipe is leaking, broken and without proper installation. Most of the water taps are without cap, although in winter it is necessary to keep open one of the taps in the house to avoid freezing the water inside the tap, but unfortunately in Skardu, through the year taps are open and water goes waste.
2.3.5	Climate Change 
Climate change is one of the main reasons behind the water crisis. As the climate change impact continues to deepen, water resources are becoming more limited due to increase in temperature and decrease in snowfall ratio as well as shrinking the size of glaciers.
2.3.6	Lack of Water Related Infrastructures 
Despite having fresh water sources in the area government is unable to use these God gifted water sources due to lack of investment in water related infrastructures.  There are countless water points which can be harnessed easily and with low cost but still left unattended. Furthermore, quantity and quality of already installed pipes for drinking is often very low which causes leakages leading to water shortage.
2.3.7	Delay in Shatung Diversion 
As mentioned above, Shatung Nala in Devo Sai was part of Satpara Dam but unfortunately after one and half decade still water from Shatung cannot be diverted into the Dam, which has left the Dam inefficient and unproductive. Consequently, water crisis took place in Skardu which will continue in future too, unless Shatung is not diverted into the Dam or any other sources of water is not identified and diverted. 
2.4	Call for water diversion from Devo Sai
Keeping in view the water crisis, the Immamiya Markaz Skardu in collaboration with Markaz-e- Ahlesunnat, Markaz-e- Ahlehadid, Markaz-e- Noorbukhshia and Ismali Markaz called to the local community to join hands to divert water from Fiya Lung Satpara Dam on self-help basis. This called was appreciated by all people living in Skardu and ensured financial and human support to the Markaz for this noble cause. After several meetings with elders, all religious centres, and local communities living in and around Skardu, it was decided that since Government is already working on Shatung Diversion however it will take over five years, therefore, alternate sources will be identified which can easily and immediately be diverted in to the Dam. Given the fact and ground realities, people from all walk of life ensured support to the water diversion team. This call was not appreciated only by the water rights areas and Skardu city but also highly appreciated by other areas including Gilgit. Each village in the water rights area invited the water diversion team to their villages to show their support and collaboration with the team. Apart from the local communities, political parties, religious groups, development sector and local government as well as elected representatives have also appreciated this call and ensured their full support to this team. 
2.5	Water Sources Other than Shatung
As mentioned above that without Shatung Nala diversion, water requirement of Skardu in future will not be fulfilled. The construction of Shatung after its feasibility will take 5 to 10 years’ period, therefore a quick and easy solution is required till Shatung is diverted. Keeping in view the water shortage in Skardu city and surroundings, alternate sources were identified including harnessing underground water through solar lifting, diverting Indus river through surface channel and diverting other than Shatung Nala from Devo Sai. In this regard, a nala named “Whatpi Fong” was identified which is the shortest to divert and water is available for throughout the year. This Nala has two sources; one is Fiya Lung which comes from a glacier while other is Khalangma Lung which originates from two lakes.

2.7	Survey Team
After several visits of experts, local people and elders of the area, it was decided that water from Whatpi Fong Nala will be diverted because it seems feasible with availability of required quantity of water in off-seasons. Based on the initial feasibility visit, a survey team was deputed for detail survey and cost estimate has been prepared. Detail of survey team is given below;

2.8	Survey Method
Two Total Stations were used to complete the survey and Missing Line Measurement (MLM) method was used to complete the survey. The data for project plan was collected through handi GPs and profile and Cross Section were prepared through MLM. Autocade was used for NSL (Natural Surface Level) and Earth Work Quantity. Keeping the tail at zero, backward (tail to head) survey by maintaining 1:600 level ratio. The difference between head to tail is 66 feet. 


2.9	Main features of the proposed project 
The technical team has prepared cost estimation for four kind of project nature including (a) Earthen open channel, (b) Cover channel with stone masonry, (c) 36 inches dia HDP pipe, and (d) RCC box channel.  After a lengthy discussion among general body, it was decided to build a covered RCC (box) channel with the following specification;
-		Total Length of the project	33,500 feet (10 km)
-		Width 	4 feet
-		Height   	5 feet 5 inch
-		Slop maintained 	1 into 600
-		Head to tail difference 	66 feet
-		Approach road 	12 feet
-		Diversion place	Submerge Weir and tank
-		Working season 	3 to 4 months 
-		Height of the project site (from Sea level)	13,500 to 13,600 feet
-		Capacity of the channel at source 	110 Cusecs
-		Water losses 	10 Cusecs 
-		Water available at the tail end 	100 Cusecs 
  
2.10	Cost Estimation
The main cost of the project is the construction of RCC box channel where cement and steel will be used. Main head wise cost is given in the following table while the detail cost estimation with quantities can be seen in the design report which is annex with this proposal. 
 

2.11	Project Management
2.11.1	Project Execution 
The project will be executed by a technical team headed by the director programmes. The construction part will be handed over to a team of selected experienced contractors. However, to maintain quality of materials, cement and steel will be provided by the purchase committee of the organisation while the contractors will use their own machinery, labour and rest of the materials. The project will be divided into 5 sections and for each section a contractor will be hired. A detail work plan is given as Annex **
2.11.2	Project Completion period 
Given the tuff climatic condition and short working season which only 3 to 4 months, this project will be completed within 3 years, however all the efforts will be made to complete the project within 2 years.  
2.12	Fund raising
In order to raise fund for the project, a Directorate for Resource mobilisation has been established, this Directorate (headed by the director resource mobilisation) will contact with donors (water users, funding agencies, companies, NGOs and individuals). A series of meetings with all stakeholders have already been conducted and request for financial and technical support has been made. 
First, financial support will be sought out from local communities where as per household Rs. 20,000 has been fixed, while government, elected representatives, development agencies, associations, companies and individual philanthropies will be contacted for donation and funding. 

2.13	Outcomes of the Project 
There is no doubt that the project will have an immense impact on the lives of the people living in Skardu particularly and Baltistan generally. Specifically, the project will have the following outcome;
a)	Social harmony among all sects, language and districts of the region 
b)	Provision of water for 250,000 people living in Skardu city and surroundings 
c)	Provision of irrigation water to approximately 15,000 acres of land
d)	Provision of water for millions of tourists visiting the area throughout the year 
e)	Increase crop and fruit production leading improvement in health because of improved food and fruit intake
f)	Increase farm related jobs and businesses in the area (food and fruit processing etc.)
g)	Improve health and hygiene condition of people due to availability of water for drinking, washing and bathing
h)	Revival of tradition of collaborative communal activities 
i)	Increase greenery of the area and improve environment 
j)	Increase efficiency of Satpara Dam 
According to a simple cost benefit analysis, the project will be beneficial right from the completion which year 2. The cost benefit ratio is 3.69 while IRR is 63.08%
